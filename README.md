# Unemployment_Time_Series
Time Series Analysis of Unemployment

This was a project for one of my statistics courses in graduate school. Using R, I forecasted US Unemployment rates using an ARIMA model and using a VaR model. For the VaR model, I used approved number of building permits in the US as a leading indicator.
